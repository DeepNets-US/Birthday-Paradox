## Description

The Birthday Paradox is a classic problem in probability theory. It asks: How many people must be in a room for there to be a 50% chance that at least two people have the same birthday? This web application helps you simulate the Birthday Paradox and visualize the results.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the concept of the Birthday Paradox from the field of probability and was developed for educational purposes.

## Features

- Simulate the Birthday Paradox by specifying the number of people.
- Set the total number of simulations.
- Define the number of steps to update and visualize the probability.
- Visualize the simulation results in line and bar charts.

## User Interface

### Number of People

Specify the number of people in the room for the simulation. This parameter determines the size of the group for which you want to calculate the birthday paradox.

### Total Simulations

Set the total number of simulations to run. This parameter controls how many times the simulation will be repeated to calculate the final probability.

### Steps

Define the number of steps at which you want to update and visualize the probability. The simulation will keep track of the probability at each step.
